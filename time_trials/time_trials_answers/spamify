Cheer up, Brian.  You know what they say.
Some things in spam are bad,
They can really make you mad.
Other things just make you swear and curse.
When you're chewing on spam's gristle,
Don't grumble, give a wistle!
And this'll help things turn out for the best...
And always look on the bright side of spam!
 
Always look on the bright side of spam...
If spam seems jolly rotten,
There's something you've forgotten!
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing,
 
When you're feeling in the dumps,
Don't be silly chumps,
Just purse your lips and whistle -- that's the thing!
And always look on the bright side of spam...
 
Come on!
 
Always look on the bright side of spam...
 
For spam is quite absurd,
And death's the final word.
You must always face the curtain with a bow!
Forget about your sin -- give the audience a grin,
Enjoy it -- it's the last chance anyhow!
 
So always look on the bright side of death!
Just before you draw your terminal breath.
Spam's a piece of shit,
When you look at it.
 
Spam's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true,
You'll see it's all a show,
Keep 'em laughing as you go.
Just remember that the last laugh is on you!
 
And always look on the bright side of spam...
Always look on the bright side of spam

Come on guys, cheer up

Always look on the bright side of spam...

Always look on the bright side of spam...

Worse things happen at sea you know

Always look on the bright side of spam...

I mean--what have you got to lose?
You know, you come from nothing
You're going back to nothing
What have you lost? Nothing!

Always look on the bright side of spam...
