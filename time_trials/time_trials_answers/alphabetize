Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life...
Always look on the bright side of life...
Always look on the bright side of life...
Always look on the bright side of life...
Always look on the bright side of life...
Always look on the bright side of life...
And always look on the bright side of life!
And always look on the bright side of life...
And always look on the bright side of life...
And death's the final word.
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing,
And this'll help things turn out for the best...
Cheer up, Brian.  You know what they say.
Come on guys, cheer up
Come on!
Don't be silly chumps,
Don't grumble, give a wistle!
Enjoy it -- it's the last chance anyhow!
For life is quite absurd,
Forget about your sin -- give the audience a grin,
I mean--what have you got to lose?
If life seems jolly rotten,
Just before you draw your terminal breath.
Just purse your lips and whistle -- that's the thing!
Just remember that the last laugh is on you!
Keep 'em laughing as you go.
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true,
Life's a piece of shit,
Other things just make you swear and curse.
So always look on the bright side of death!
Some things in life are bad,
There's something you've forgotten!
They can really make you mad.
What have you lost? Nothing!
When you look at it.
When you're chewing on life's gristle,
When you're feeling in the dumps,
Worse things happen at sea you know
You know, you come from nothing
You must always face the curtain with a bow!
You'll see it's all a show,
You're going back to nothing
